# Azure 1st Data Engineering Project

Welcome to my first data engineering project using Azure! This project leverages a free trial Azure subscription, which limited the use of certain resources such as Azure Synapse.

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

In this project, I performed the following steps:

1. **Database Setup**: 
   - Used SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to manage the database.
   
2. **Data Loading**: 
   - Utilized Azure Data Factory to load data into the cloud.
   - Stored data in Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) in the Bronze layer.
   
3. **Data Transformation**: 
   - Transformed data using Azure Databricks.
   - Moved data from the Bronze layer to the Silver layer, and then from Silver to Gold.
   
4. **Data Migration**: 
   - Transferred data from ADLS to an Azure SQL Database using Azure Data Factory.
   
5. **Testing and Deployment**: 
   - Set up testing to ensure successful deployment of the project.
   
6. **Data Reporting**: 
   - Created data reports using Power BI to gain insights from the data.
